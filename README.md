# This is API(Resource Server) branch of this project

## What this server do?

As i said, this is a resource server that has user and app data. If i'm making real service, i need to set one more server for authorization(called "authorization server") but this is just practice. So i will just put all server side things(resource server and authorization server) to this branch. What you need to know is, this server don't have any database. Server's `database.js` will do similar works. This mean, data what you save in this server will not actually be saved.
